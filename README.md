This is a 4 bit adder/subtractor built in Logisim, built from scratch using CMOS logic
It accepts both signed and unsigned input with overflow detection a 7-segment display for input and output
However, as a twist, input and output are both displayed in base 4
CMOS NAND gates form the basis of all the other logic gates using gate substitution
Everything else (cascading half/full adders, 7 segment display, etc...) are all built using logic gates
File is extremely large and takes a long time to load. Do not attempt to make changes, because it will freeze.
